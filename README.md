## Hi there👋, my name is Sabyasachi Ghosh.

## About Me

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Sabyasachi-Data&color=blueviolet&style=flat)

I am a computational mechanics researcher and PhD candidate at the [Applied Mechanics](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/StudDetails/?id=MTYxNQ==) Department of IIEST Shibpur, India.  

My research interests include the dynamic analysis of laminated composite structures, finite element methods (utilising ABAQUS, ANSYS, and FORTRAN), structural health monitoring (SHM), and physics-informed neural networks for dynamic analysis and SHM applications.  

- 🔭 Currently SME @ Mercor, evaluating ML models
- 🌱 I’m currently upskilling in neural networks, SQL and Power BI 🚀
- 📄 All my latest publications are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MDWJF_sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

## 📦 Featured Projects

### 🔬 [Gaussian Process Machine Learning Surrogate Model](https://github.com/Sabyasachi-Data/Shell-GP-Machine-Learning-Surrogate-Model)

**A modular Python framework for uncertainty quantification and global sensitivity analysis in computational mechanics**

Developed a ML pipeline for predicting composite shell natural frequency with:

- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Custom scikit-learn transformers, multiple kernel options 
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Predictions with standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals
- **Sobol Sensitivity Analysis**: First/total/second-order indices using ~1M model evaluations
- **Visualizations**: Parity plots, residual analysis, sensitivity heatmaps, predicitions with uncertainty
- **Publication**: Published in international peer-reviewed journals

**Tech Stack:** `Python` · `scikit-learn` · `Matplotlib` · `NumPy` · `Pandas` . `Seaborn`
