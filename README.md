## Hi there 👋
I am [Sabyasachi](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/StudDetails/?id=MTYxNQ==), a computational mechanics researcher and PhD candidate at the Applied Mechanics Department of IIEST Shibpur, India.  

My research interests include the dynamic analysis of laminated composite structures, finite element methods (utilising ABAQUS, ANSYS, and FORTRAN), structural health monitoring (SHM), and physics-informed neural networks for dynamic analysis and SHM applications.  

Skilled 👨🏻‍💻 in Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, data analysis and visualisation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification.

Currently SME @ Mercor, evaluating ML models & upskilling in neural networks, SQL and Power BI 🚀

Seeking exciting, pivotal industry ML/data science roles or high-impact postdoctoral opportunities integrating AI with computational mechanics and structural engineering problems.
