## Hi there👋, my name is Sabyasachi Ghosh.

## About Me

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Sabyasachi-Data&color=blueviolet&style=flat)

I am a computational mechanics researcher and PhD candidate at the [Applied Mechanics](https://www.iiests.ac.in/IIEST/StudDetails/?id=MTYxNQ==) Department of IIEST Shibpur, India.  

My research interests include the dynamic analysis of laminated composite structures, finite element methods (utilising ABAQUS, ANSYS, and FORTRAN), structural health monitoring (SHM), and physics-informed neural networks for dynamic analysis and SHM applications.  

- 🔭 Currently SME @ Mercor, evaluating ML models
- 🌱 I’m currently upskilling in neural networks, SQL and Power BI 🚀

All my latest publications are available [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MDWJF_sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

## I am currently seeking:

- 🎯 Exciting pivotal industry ML/data science roles in health-tech, finance or consulting fields
- ⚡ high-impact postdoctoral opportunities integrating AI with computational mechanics and structural engineering problems.  

## 👨🏻‍💻 I am skilled in: 

Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, data analysis and visualisation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification.
